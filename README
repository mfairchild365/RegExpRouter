RegExpRouter
=================

Introduction
-----------------
RegExpRouter is a php router system that routes clean URLs based on regular expressions.

For each Model that has a route, you will need to place a file named "Routes" within that class, which implements RegExpRouter_RoutesInterface and define the regex routes for the model.

The router will only work if you have your php class file system set up like this:
/Example
    /Example
       /Routes.php (class name for Routes.php would be Example_Routes because its sits in he 'Example' directory.)

View the very simple Example application in the Example folder to get a better feel of how it works.

To set up the example application you will have to do the following:
1) Copy the config.sample.php to a new file called config.inc.php in the same folder.
2) Change the Example_Controller::$url in config.inc.php to a url that works with your setup.
3) Copy the sample.htaccess file to a new file called .htaccess in the same folder.
4) In .htaccess change the RewriteBase path to work with your setup.
